## CPSC 120

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-david-and-faizan)

    Lab 8 part 2 was a standout due to its practical focus on command-line argument handling in C++ and the emphasis on arithmetic operations for calculating averages. This hands-on experience not only refined my error-handling skills but also solidified my grasp of fundamental programming principles, particularty in executing precise arithmetic calculations to derive accurate results.

    Lab 2 part 2 stood out for me as the second favorite because it cleverly took words I entered and made them into a litte story. It was neat seeing how my words turned into sentences. This helped me learn about words and how computers can use them in an interesting way.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-lupe-and-faizan)
    Lab 6 part 2 ranked third among my favorites due to its foundational role in blackjack simulation. The code contains functions defining card values with precision, especially distinguishing Aces, Face Cards, and number cards. These functions form the essential logic for computing scores and managing key aspects in a simulated blackjack game.
